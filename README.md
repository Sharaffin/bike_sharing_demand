<p>Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.</p>

<h2> :floppy_disk: Data Description</h2>

<p>The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information</p>

**Date** : year-month-day

**Rented Bike count** : Count of bikes rented at each  hour

**Hour** : Hour of the day

**Temperature** : in Celsius

**Humidity** : %

**Wind Speed** : m/s

**Visibility** : 10m

**Dew point Temperature** :Celsius

**Solar_radiation** : MJ/m2

**Rainfall** : mm

**Seasons** : Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn ∙ Holiday - Holiday/No holiday 

**Functional Day** : NoFunc(Non Functional Hours),  Fun(Functional hours)

<h2> :floppy_disk: Data Pipeline</h2>

● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In this part we have done some EDA on the features to see the trend.

● Data Processing: In this part we went through each attributes and encoded the categorical features.

● Model Creation: Finally in this part we created the various models. These various models are being analysed and we tried to study various models so as to get the best performing model for our project.

<h2> :clipboard: Future Work</h2>
<p> It is useful in the full design of the system, including the location of bike-sharing stations and in the dimension of the fleet, as well as in the scheduling of the investments. Further work can include the consideration of other socio-economic characteristics, such as population density,  job density, retail job density, commute trip, reduction companies, tourist attractions, parks/recreation areas, topography, regional transit stations, bicycle friendly streets, streets with bicycle lanes and local transit stops. To further increase the performance of the model’s external parameters can be included which affects the bike usage. Moreover the study scope allows it to be applied to other modes of transportation. </p>

<h2>:floppy_disk: Conclusion</h2>
<p>As we can see the total amount of bike Rentals increases with the temperature per month. Whereas it seems that the rentals are independent of the wind 
 speed and the humidity, because they are almost constant over the months. This also confirms on the one hand the high correlation between rentals
and temperature and on the other hand that nice weather could be a good predictor. So people mainly rent bikes on nice days and nice temperature. 
This could be important of planning new bike rental stations.</p>
